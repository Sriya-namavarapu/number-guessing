# Number Guessing Game in C++

## Overview
This is a simple command-line Number Guessing Game written in C++. In this game, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to guess the number, and the game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number (10 attempts).
- Feedback is provided after each guess whether the guess is too high or too low.
- The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or exhausts all attempts.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual C++).

## Instructions
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.

2. Run the compiled program.

3. The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100. You will have 10 attempts to guess the correct number.

4. After each guess, the program will tell you whether your guess is too high or too low.

5. If you guess correctly, the game will display a success message and the number of attempts it took.

6. If you exhaust all 10 attempts without guessing correctly, the game will reveal the correct number.
